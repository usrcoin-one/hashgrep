A skeleton for benching rolling hash functions.

Still incomplete.  But getting there.

Requires a file called "infile" for now.  That'll get fixed later.


The individual hash functions get compiled against the hashbench base program and turn into binaries named hash_{x}, one per hash function.

distcomp.rb is a "how good is this hash function" evaluator.

timecomp.rb benchmarks the runtime of each hash function against the
input file.
